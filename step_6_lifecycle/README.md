# Congo: Container Implementation with Lifecycle Management

## Step 6: Container Lifecycle Management

This implementation extends our container solution with comprehensive lifecycle management capabilities. The lifecycle system provides commands to create, start, stop, pause, and manage containers throughout their entire lifecycle, similar to production container systems.

### Key Features

- Container create, start, stop, and remove operations
- Container pausing and unpausing capabilities
- Resource limit updates for running containers
- Container commit functionality to create images
- Volume management during container runtime
- Container logs viewing
- Interactive and detached execution modes
- Container listing with detailed state information

### Architecture

The lifecycle management system maintains container state in a persistent store, allowing containers to be managed across multiple sessions. Each container has a unique ID and maintains information about its resources, mounts, network configuration, and current status.

### Getting Started

See the [Usage Guide](usage.md) for instructions on how to use the lifecycle management features.

### Function Documentation

For detailed information about the implementation, see the [Functions Guide](functions.md).
