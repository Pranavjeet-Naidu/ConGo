# Congo: Container Implementation with Resource Monitoring

## Step 5: Resource Monitoring

This implementation extends our container solution with comprehensive resource monitoring capabilities. The monitoring system tracks resource usage within the container including CPU, memory, and process counts, providing insights into container performance and utilization.

### Key Features

- Real-time monitoring of container resources
- Configurable monitoring interval
- Output to specified stats files
- Selective monitoring of specific resources (CPU, memory, processes)
- Integration with existing logging infrastructure

### Architecture

The monitoring system runs as a background goroutine that periodically collects resource statistics from cgroups and writes them to a configured stats file. This non-intrusive approach ensures that monitoring doesn't interfere with container operations.

### Getting Started

See the [Usage Guide](usage.md) for instructions on how to use the monitoring features.

### Function Documentation
